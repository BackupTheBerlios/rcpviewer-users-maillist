<PRE>MR.CHEN QINGXUAN 
HANG SENG BANK LTD.
DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONK KONG.

Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Chen qingxuan credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I 
have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.

I honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this 
means for a transaction of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on 
this medium, sorry my English is not very good. Furthermore, due to this issue on my hands now, it 
became necessary for me to seek your assistance, and it is imperative for me to know your opinion.

On April 6 ,2000, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the ChinesePetroleum and Chemical 
orporation Mr. Richard Nault made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at 
US$30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to 
his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminderand finally we discovered from 
his contract employers, the Hong Kong Petroleum and Chemical Corporation that Mr. Richard Nault died 
from an automobile accident.

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next 
of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Nault did not 
declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, includinghis Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 
This sum of US$30,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the  interest is being rolled over with the 
principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of 
Hong Kong, at the expiration of 5(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong 
Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard 
Nault so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government 
officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the 
attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.

We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the 
necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. The money will be 
paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 35% for you and 5% for Expenses 
Incurred in the course of the transaction.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and with my 
position as the credit officer guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are really  
interested in doing this business with me please reply immediately to this emal address,

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/rcpviewer-users">chenqinw at levele.hu</A> 

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you 
understand the transaction.

Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.
You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable 
for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply.
Thanks and regards.
Mr. Chen qingxuan
